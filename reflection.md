Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Alex Wood & Samantha Pincus - it was helpful to see how others attacked the problem & we helped each other with Java syntax!
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Wednesday, September 25th - TA hours! I didn't really have any specific questions as it was just figuring out the syntax for me but it was good to be an environment where I knew there was help available!
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I am so used to Python -- I am not used at all to defining everything so explicitly. While it is a little bit of a headache when writing simpler programs like this one, I can definitely see how it would make things way way easier when coding bigger projects. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
On a grander scale, especially in a program that is heavily interactive, it is easier to think of code in an object-oriented manner as opposed to procedurally. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Talking out my ideas, even to a person who is not involved in CS at all, is very helpful because sometimes articulating my ideas shows that they either do / don't make sense. I still haven't figured out all the intricacies -- particularly with the mirrored responses. I would tell someone taking this course in the future to collaborate!!! I mostly did this by myself but I think it would've been a lot easier and faster had I collaborated more with my peers instead of talking at the very end.
